# Exam
- **Date & Time:** The date of the exam will be determined after November 9th

The exam will be a digital take-home exam which is set to take place on **EXAM
DATE**.
You will have 9 hours to complete the exam but you will probably not need the full time to complete the exam.
I have added extra time for you to be able to think and also to account for
problems that may arise. Also, we reserve the right to conduct an oral
exam after the take home exam. That is, you might need to explain your solutions to 
the exam problems if asked.

Since you have access to the internet,
the exam will be more difficult than usual. You are allowed to use any tools you
want to solve the problems as long as it is your own solution. This means, that
you are **NOT** allowed to copy code from the internet, copy code from chat-gpt, use libraries
that are non-standard, etc. However, you can use these sources of inspiration.

**More information about exam will be updated here soon..**
