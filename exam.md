## Overview

The exam will be a digital take-home exam which is set to take place on **8th of
January, 2024**. You will have 9 hours to complete the exam but you will
probably not need the full time to complete the exam. I have added extra time
for you to be able to think and also to account for problems that may arise.
Also, we reserve the right to conduct an oral exam after the take home exam.
That is, you might need to explain your solutions to the exam problems if asked.

Since you have access to the internet, the exam will be more difficult than
usual. You are allowed to use any tools you want to solve the problems as long
as it is your own solution. This means, that you are **NOT** allowed to copy
code from the internet, copy code from chat-gpt, use libraries that are
non-standard, etc. However, you can use these sources of inspiration.




## Format

The exam has **two** parts: a theoretical section and a practical section. Both
parts must be successfully completed to pass the exam.

### Theoretical

The theoretical section comprises **three** tasks, each valued at **five**
points. A minimum of **seven** points is necessary to pass this segment. These tasks
are designed to evaluate your understanding of the course concepts, emphasizing
understanding of the main points covered in the course.


### Practical

The practical segment includes **three** tasks, each carrying a value of **ten** points.
A minimum of **fifteen** points is necessary to successfully complete this part.

The tasks in this section closely mirror those encountered in the homework,
involving actions such as retrieving, aggregating, wrangling, and visualizing
data.
