## Summary

In this lecture, we are going to learn how to use RegEx to pattern match
strings. We will see how powerful it is to use RegEx to bulk search for
patterns. It is industry standard and can be used in all of the tools
we have used so far, i.e Python/R and SQL. 

## RegEx

Regular Expressions (RegEx) is a powerful tool used in computer science and
programming for pattern matching within strings. It provides a concise and
flexible means of searching, matching, and manipulating text based on patterns.

A regular expression is a sequence of characters (a type of query) that defines
a search pattern. These patterns can include a variety of elements such as
literal characters, metacharacters (special characters with specific meanings), and
quantifiers (to specify the number of occurrences). Regex is commonly used in
tasks like text searching, validation, and text manipulation.

Before diving in to the syntax of RegEx, let's look at a simple example. 

Consider a scenario where you want to extract email addresses from a text, for
instance the following text. 

> Please contact support@example.com for assistance. For general inquiries, you can email info@company.com.

We can use the following RegEx to extract the emails in this text by matching
them to a specific format.

```regex
\b[\w._%+-]+@[\w.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}\b
```

The expression above might look daunting but it will make sense when you get
thet gist of RegEx. Lets break down this expression. 

- \b: Word boundary to ensure that the match is a whole word and not part of a
  larger sequence. For instance, `\bcat\b` will match the word *cat* but not
  *scattered*. 
- [\w._%+-]+: Matches the username part of the email address, allowing
  alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and
  hyphens. Here `\w` is a **metacharacter** which is short for `A-Za-z0-9`. `+`
  **outside** of the brackets matches 1 or more of the proceeding character.
- @: Matches the **at** symbol.
- [\w.-]+: Matches the domain name, allowing alphanumeric characters, dots, and
  hyphens.
- \.: Matches the dot before the top-level domain.
- [A-Z|a-z]{2,4}: Matches the top-level domain (eg. .com) with at least two and
  at most 4 characters .
- \b: Word boundary to complete the match.

To summarise The following image illustrates what we have done.

Even if it does not make sense yet that is fine. 

### Basic Syntax

Some important definitions in regex are the following.

#### Literals
Characters in a regex pattern that match themselves. For example, the regex `abc` will match the string "abc" in the input.

#### Metacharacters
Special characters with a specific meaning in regex. Some common metacharacters include:
   - `.` (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.
   - `^`: Anchors the regex at the start of the string.
   - `$`: Anchors the regex at the end of the string.
   - `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
   - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character or group.
   - `|`: Acts like a logical OR, allowing alternatives. For example, `a|b` matches either "a" or "b".
   - `()`: Groups characters together. For example, `(abc)+` matches one or more occurrences of "abc".

#### Character Classes
   - `[ ]`: Defines a character class. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.
   - `[^ ]`: Negates a character class. For example, `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit character.

#### Quantifiers
Control the number of occurrences of a character or group.
   - `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.
   - `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.
   - `{n,m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.

#### Escape sequences
Use a backslash `\` to escape a metacharacter, allowing it to be treated as a literal character. For example, `\.` matches a literal period.

#### Predefined character classes
   - `\d`: Matches any digit (equivalent to `[0-9]`).
   - `\D`: Matches any non-digit.
   - `\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
   - `\W`: Matches any non-word character.
   - `\s`: Matches any whitespace character.
   - `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.

#### Anchors
Specify the position in the string where a match must occur.
   - `\b`: Word boundary.
   - `\B`: Non-word boundary.
   - `^`: Start of a line.
   - `$`: End of a line.

#### Modifiers
   - `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
   - `g`: Global matching (find all matches, not just the first).

#### Wildcard
`.*` is a common pattern to match any character (except newline) zero or more times.

I strongly believe that you learn regex by examples. So let's look a typical
example of regex.

### Example: Extracting Email Addresses from a List

Suppose you have a list of email addresses:

```txt john.doe@example.com jane.smith@gmail.com alice.jones@example.com
bob.miller@yahoo.com ```

Now, let's say you want to extract all the email addresses from the domain
example.com. You can use the following regex:


```regex \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@example\.com\b
```

Explanation:

\b: Word boundary to ensure that we match the entire domain, not just a part of
it. [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+: Matches the username part of the email address, allowing
letters, numbers, dots, underscores, percent signs, plus signs, and hyphens.
@example\.com: Matches the domain part, specifically example.com.

This pattern will match the following strings.
```
['john.doe@example.com', 'alice.jones@example.com']
```

This is a simple example of regex that is meant to illustrate the
power of it.

### Exercises

Here are some excersises, try them out on your own!

#### Simple Email Validation 
````txt
john.doe@example.com
jane.smith@gmail.com
alice.jones123@yahoo.com
invalid.email@domain
````

Output should be:
```txt
Valid Email Addresses:
- john.doe@example.com
- jane.smith@gmail.com
- alice.jones123@yahoo.com

Invalid Email Addresses:
- invalid.email@domain
```

### Extracting Phone Numbers

````txt 
Phone numbers: 123-456-7890, (555) 987-6543, 9876543210, 555-1234
Invalid: 12-345-6789, 555-98765, abcdefgh
````

Ouput should be:
```txt
Valid Phone Numbers:
- 123-456-7890
- (555) 987-6543
- 9876543210
- 555-1234

Invalid Phone Numbers:
- 12-345-6789
- 555-98765
- abcdefgh
```
### Extracting HTML Tags and Attributes

```txt
<p class="intro">This is a <strong>sample</strong> paragraph.</p>
<p>No class here.</p>
<div id="container" class="main">
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Content</p>
</div>
```
Output should be: 
```txt
HTML Tags and Attributes:
- <p class="intro">
- <strong>

Attributes in <div>:
- id="container"
- class="main"
```

You can execute RegEx using Python or R. Look at the resources for how to do
this!
