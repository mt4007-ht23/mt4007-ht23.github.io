## Summary

In this lecture on REST APIs, we will be diving into the core principles REST as
a communication framework for applications and we will learn how to practically
work with REST APIs. The goal is to understand the standardized and efficient method
for retrieving resources through network communication.

## REST APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer Application) APIs is a communications
framework for applications, typically, web applications. In REST the application
(requesting) resources is called the *client* and the application that responds
is called the *server*. For instance, when you are at a restaurant, you are
requesting food, which makes you the client. The restaurant serves you the food
that you have requested. That is, the restaurant responds to you request. This
makes the restaurant the server.

The REST framework specifies rules on how consitutents communicate in a network.
There are several other frameworks for communication but REST is standard. 

### The Framework 

In REST, everything is a resource. Resources are identified by unique URIs
(Uniform Resource Identifiers). The clients in the network communicate
using HTTP methods. E.g `GET` to retrieve resources, `POST` to create new
resources, `PUT` to update resources, `DELETE` to remove resources. There are
several more HTTP methods but these are the most common ones. Resources have one
or more representations, which can be in various formats such as [JSON](#json)
or [XML](#xml). 

Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information need to
understand and fulfill the request. The server doesn't store any infomation
about the client inbetween requests. This makes REST stateless communications
framework.

The idea is that everytime you make a request, you get a response containing
some resource(s). For instance, imagine we are searching for something on
google, we are in other words making a request to googles servers, and the
server responds with the search results. The REST pattern is everywhere on the
internet. The figure below illustrates this idea.

Before we continue on about REST APIs, we should consider why this is important
to learn. For data scientist, most of the data will be provided from an
organizations through the internet. It is highly unlikely, that you will be
handed a usb containing data files. Therefore, retrieving data in a standardised
format is essential. REST is the standard way of retrieving resources through a
network. 

Another motivation to why we should learn about REST APIs is because of the
scope of the tool. REST is an efficent way to communicate in a network and the
type of communication and network is arbitrary. In the motivation above, the
resource was data but it can be anything. For instance, smart lights communicate
using REST. We make a request from our mobile app to turn on/off a specific
light. The app sends a request to the lamp server and the resource is then a
physical action. This is how IKEA smart home works. This is just scratching the
surface of the possibilities for REST APIs.

### Request

The request has the following structure that needs to be specified. The
request consists of a

- **URI**: Specifying the location of the resource you are requesting.
- **Method**: Specifying the type of request. E.g. `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`,
  `PUT` and so on.
- **Header**:  The headers provide additional information about the request or
  the client. The information needed is dependent on the API.
- **Body**: Optionally, you can send data with you request, this is passed in
  the body of the request. 

### Response

The response consists of a 

- **Status**: Information of the status of the request. For instance status code
- **Header**: The header provide additional information about the response or
  the server. The information needed is dependent on the API.
- **Body**: The response consists of a body that contains the resource(s)
  requested (if request has been accepted).

### Resources

The resource is what we are after, but they can come in different types of
representations.

#### Representation 

The resource can be arbitrary but it can be of the form of some data in this
case it is usually represented in a standard format. Here are some common
formats. 

##### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format that
is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and
generate. JSON represents data as key-value pairs, similar to how objects are
represented in python. Each key is a string, and values can be strings, numbers,
objects, arrays, booleans, or null. See the following JSON representation of an
individual.

```json 
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "address": {
    "city": "Exampleville",
    "country": "JSONland"
  },
  "hobbies": ["reading", "coding", "traveling"]
}
```
Again, it is very easy to read and parse. This is a very typical representation
of a resource. 

##### XML 

eXtensible Markup Language (XML), is a markup language designed to store and transport
data. It is a flexible format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
See the following XML representation of an individual. 
```xml
<person>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <isStudent>false</isStudent>
  <address>
    <city>Exampleville</city>
    <country>XMLland</country>
  </address>
  <hobbies>
    <hobby>reading</hobby>
    <hobby>coding</hobby>
    <hobby>traveling</hobby>
  </hobbies>
</person>
```
Again XML is easy to read and parse. Less common than JSON but still very
common.

## Example

The internet communicates using the REST framework. In this case the request is
a website and the response html. The browser then parses the html and shows you
the website. Under the hood, you web browser (e.g Chrome) makes a `GET` request
to some server on the network(internet) and the server responds with the code
for the website. 

Let's try to make our own request without using the browser. We can get the
course schedule information from the Time Edit page. 

The URI:
`https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/ri167XQQ508Z50Qv57093gZ6y3Y7806Q5Y65Y1.json`.
This is where the resource is located. Furthermore, we need to specify the
method type. In this case we are making a `GET` request.

The request 
:::code-group
```Python 
import requests 

# Making a get requests to URI
URI = "https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/ri167XQQ508Z50Qv57093gZ6y3Y7806Q5Y65Y1.json"
response = requests.get(URI)

data = response.json()
```

```R 
# Since R does not naturally have a similar structure to json, we need a few
more libaries to work with JSON.

library(httr2)
library(jsonlite) # Parse JSON
library(listviewer) # View Json

URI <- "https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/ri167XQQ508Z50Qv57093gZ6y3Y7806Q5Y65Y1.json"
request <- request(URI)
response <- req_perform(request)
json <- response %>% resp_body_string
jsonedit(json) # View the JSON in  a nice way

data <- fromJSON(json)
```
:::

The response body contains the following data:
```json 
{'columnheaders': ['Lokal',
  'Karta',
  'Kurs',
  'Kurstillfälle',
  'Delkurs, Moment',
  'Aktivitet',
  'Studentgrupp',
  'Lärare',
  'Information',
  'Litteraturinfo',
  'Tentamenssal',
  'URL',
  'Viktigt meddelande'],
 'info': {'reservationlimit': 1000, 'reservationcount': 7},
 'reservations': [{'id': '2612025',
   'startdate': '2023-12-01',
   'starttime': '13:00',
   'enddate': '2023-12-01',
   'endtime': '17:00',
   'columns': ['Lärosal 17. Albano Hus 2. Vån 2',
    'https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=59.35523&mlon=18.05639#map=18/59.35523/18.05639',
    'MT4007',
    '48182. H23. 50%. DAG. NML',
    '',
    'Föreläsning',
    '',
    'Taariq Fahran Nazar',
...
```

It is a simple as that! To get the data into a nice format we need to wrangle
the raw data. This however we already know how to do.
