## Summary

In this lecture we will go through the basics of SQL. This includes the basic
syntax for making queries to the database. This includes both retrieving and
storing data in the database.

## SQL 

What is SQL? Structured Query Language (SQL) is a computer language that enables
us to communicate and manipulate SQL databases(db) and it is one of the most widely used
languages for db management. 

There are many flavours (versions) of SQL. However, they all
share the basic syntax as below and often only differ in the way the basic
syntax is extended.

SQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), meaning that the data is
stored in tables that are seperated based on the scope of the database. A nice
illustration of how data is stored can be seen in the figure below.

Here, the tables are seperated to reflect differring objects. We also see that
the tables are linked or *related* to each other through specific variables (*keys*). This
is where the name relational database comes from.

### Basic Syntax

Writing an SQL *query*(a question or a requests) is similiar to speaking with
the database. Once we get a grasp of the basic syntax we will be able to query
the database for data in whatever form that is.

We use `SELECT` to determine the variables we want and `FROM` to specify the
table we want it from. Following the image above, we can make the following query.

```SQL
SELECT carrier, dest, tailnum
FROM flights;
```
**Make sure to end the query with `;`** 

We can use `SELELCT *` to get *all* variables in the table. The query above is
the simplest query one can make in SQL.

We can add a layer of complexity by filtering the table. We can do this by
using the `WHERE` command. Continuing the example, we can make the following query.

```SQL 
SELECT carrier, dest, tailnum
FROM flights
WHERE dest='sweden';
```
Furthermore, we can use the logical operators `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` to perform logical chaining of conditions. The basic syntax is the following.

```SQL 
SELECT variable1, variable2, ... -- * if you want all variables
FROM table
WHERE condition1 AND/OR/NOT condition2 AND/OR/NOT condition3 ...;
```

To aggregate multiple tables into a single table we can use `... JOIN`. The
syntax is similar to the previous lecture. `ON` specifies the key(s) to
join on. Continuing the example above the syntax is the following.

```SQL 
SELECT carrier, dest, tailnum, airlines.names
FROM flights
LEFT JOIN airlines ON flights.carrier = airlines.carrier;
```

Using the syntax described above, we can chain multiple operations to generate
the desired table. You can see more operations on [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

Since the SQL syntax has been adopted by both `pandas` and `tidyverse`, it will
not be difficult to learn the content above. 

### Storing Data

To start storing data, we need to create a table to store it in. We can do this
using the `CREATE` command. The query is as follows. 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  ...
);
```

To our table, we need to add columns (variable), we can do this by specifying
the name of the column and datatype. We can also specify constraints on the
variable. The query is as follows.  

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
  Variable1 datatype constraint,
  Variable2 datatype constraint,
  ...
);
```

Common constrains are `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`. There
are more constraints that can be added. They can be found on W3. 

The *unique* identifier (id) of a row should be constrained with `UNIQUE` and it
must also be filled (`NOT NULL`). The `PRIMARY KEY` incorporates both constraints.
Therefore, it is good practice to specify the row id using the `PRIMARY KEY`
constraint. 

An example of creating a table can look something like the following quer
query.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Persons (
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INT,  -- It does not need to be specified
  id_number VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY
);
```

Specific datatypes can be looked up on [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

To change a table that already exists we can use the `ALTER` command. Specific
ways to alter tables can be found on [W3](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alter.asp).

Putting it all together, the SQL query looks as follows. 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE Persons (
  Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  Age INT,  -- It does not need to be specified
  ID_number VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE Computers (
  Computer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Model VARCHAR(255),
  Brand VARCHAR(255),
  Owner VARCHAR(255) FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(ID_number) 
)
```
Here, we create two tables and use `FOREIGN KEY` to link the owner of the
computer to a specific person using the id-number. If we later realise that we
want a person to have a variable specifying occupation, we can use the following
command. 

```SQL
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD Occupation VARCHAR(255);
```

With a table created, we can add entries to the table. This can be done using
the `INSERT` command. The full syntax looks as follows.

```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (variable1, variable2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...)
```

Note that the order of the values should follow the order of the variables.
Furthermore, if the constraints are violated we will get an error. 

In the example above the query may look like

```SQL
INSERT INTO Persons (Name, ID_number)
VALUES ('Taariq', '19000101-xxxx');
```
Since, the Age variable does not need to be filled in, the query will populate
the `Persons` table and have an empty cell for the Age column.

We are only scratching the surface of SQL, there is a lot more to learn.
However, with this basic knowledge we will be able to interact with databases. 
You can find more information in the listed resources (W3). 

**There are various libraries in Python and R to interact with SQL databases. We
will primarily be working with SQLite databases since they are more accessible.
Popular libraries are [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#tutorial)
for Python and [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dbplyr.html) for
R.**
