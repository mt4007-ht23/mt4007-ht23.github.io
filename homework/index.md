# Homework

The homework portion of this course consists of 6 assigments, each paired with
peer-review of a fellow students homework. Both the assignment and the
peer-review has to be finished to pass the homework.    The deadlines for both
the assignments and peer-review are strict. If you do not manage to submit the
homework in time you will need to do extra work.

## Assigment 

The assigment will consists of a few tasks that test you on the material we have
done in the previous weeks. The homework will be available on the solve date,
that is when we have gone through the relevant material for the assignment. They
will get more difficult throughout the course. Report the solutions to the
assgiments in form of a blogpost with clear explanations and documentation of
the procedure, **not as list of answers**.

The homework is submitted to the github organisation under your own repository.
When you are finished *raise an issue*, otherwise we will not grade your
assignment.

Once your work has been assessed by the grader, you will have the opportunity to
correct the misstakes you have made. You can do this by correcting the mistakes
and leaving a comment (under the closed issue) that you have fixed the misstakes.

## Peer Review

The peer-review will be made **available every monday before 12:00**, following
the submission of the assigment. The peer-review consists of analysing a fellow
students solutions to the assigment. Give feedback on the solutions and the
report as a whole. Answers the following questions:

- Has the person answered all the questions? 
- Is there something you really like about the report?
- Is anything unclear? 

After the assigment hand-in you will have access to another students repo on the
github organisation, this is the project you are going to review. You will give
your feedback under the issue that has been raised. **Do not close the issue**.

**The deadline for the peer-review is on wednesday at 23:59.**
