# Homework 3

## Instructions

Your solutions should be in form of a report in .md format. Make sure to
document you procedure properly. You will be tasked with exploring and analysing
three datasets. Make sure that your answers are clear and that you have
documented your procedure.

When you are finished push you results to Github and raise an issue, just as you
have done in previous homeworks. To pass the homework you will have to complete
the assigments below and also finish the peer-review.

Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear.

## Exploratory Data Analysis  

### IRIS data

In the file `IRIS.csv` you will find data on three species of iris flowers. The data
contains information about the dimensions of aspects of the flower. Your task is
to visualise the dataset.

Is there a relationship between sepal dimensions and petal dimensions? Generate the following figure.

![iris-dim](/img/iris_dim.png)

What can you say about the relationship given the figure?

How are the sepal and petal dimensions distributed? Generate the following
figure. 

![iris-box](/img/iris_box.png)

What can you conclude from this figure?

The so called **pairs-plot** is a very simple way of quickly analysing realtionships
between data. Generate the following figure 

![iris-pair](/img/iris_pair.png)

Briefly, mention how the different variables are related to each other.

### Birdwatching 

På Artportalen kan du rapportera fynd eller observationer av djur, växter och
svampar. Det är ett exempel på så kallad medborgarforskning, "citizen science",
där allmänheten, forskare och tjänstemän samarbetar med att bygga upp en databas
som kan användas i forskning. Till denna laboration har vi hämtat alla
fågelobservationer gjorda 2022 i kungliga nationalstadsparken

On [Artportalen](https://www.artportalen.se/), you can find data on animals,
plats and mushrooms. The dataset has been aggregate by both scientist and
hobbyists, which is what we call *citizen science*.  In the file
`artportalen.csv` you will find data on bird sightings made in 2022 in the
[royal national park](https://www.nationalstadsparken.se/). Your task is to
explore and analyse the dataset. 

Begin by familiarising yourself with the dataset.

After you have made yourself familiar with the dataset, answer the following
questions.

- What are the most prevelant species?
- What is the monthly distribution of the top 3 most prevelant species
- What are the rarest species? 

Now it is time for you to explore the dataset on your own. Generate at least
**3** questions on your own and explore the dataset. What does these questions +
answers tell you about the data? Make sure the questions highlight something in
the dataset and is significant.

### Predicting Strokes

In the file `stroke-data.csv` you can find data about stroke cases and
information about the individuals it pertains. [find out
more](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
about the dataset. 

Your task is to explore this dataset on your own. Where does your exploration lead you? What can
you say about the dataset? Explain the content of the dataset and generate at
least **3** serious questions that give you insight.
